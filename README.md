## Introduction

## Data Used

- Using data collected from [Scott Free LLC](https://www.scottfreellc.com/shop/p/historical-odds-sample-data) to start.
- Will likely need to scrape our own Odds data to keep this updated weekly.
  - Give ESPN a shot. Might be able to get this info from the Caesars API similar to the NFL odds.
- Could be interesting to add team stats into the picture as well

## Model Feature Ideas

- Odds Data Only
  - Easy one would be to add if the team was home or away
  - Win Streak
- Stats Data Included
  - make this player specific?
  - would need to find a place to scrape game stats for college anyway. Maybe we could give ESPN a try again similar to NFL stats?
